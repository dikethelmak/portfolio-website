                                    The process of collecting data for research companies is usually very painstaking and
                                    time-consuming, a lot of them assign various agents to different locations to collect the data they
                                    need. These agents move from one location to the other using their paper and pen. In many cases,
                                    weather, transportation, and other factors get in the way of successfully collecting this data, and
                                    they end up losing parts of it. There was also the issue of validating the data collected as some
                                    agents collected the same data multiple times.
                                </p>

                                    After various sessions with users, we decided to build a solution that helps business owners and researchers collect data effortlessly and also trust the data they've collected. I was the Lead Product Designer for this platform. I worked alongside the Design Lead, my Product Manager, Engineering Lead, 3 Frontend Engineers, 1 Backend Engineer, 1 Quality Assurance expert.

                                    We created a full web application with form builders and data visualization capabilities for
                                    business owners and researchers. We also created a pool of field agents and a mobile app for them to

                                    An organization can create surveys and push them out to either their own users or our field agents. Our field agents collect these data using the mobile app, and the data is automatically uploaded to the organizations' dashboard.

                                    Research companies have to collect data for multiple organizations at the same time. We created
                                    workspaces to help them separate information between different organizations, and folders as a means
                                    to group similar forms within each organization.

                                    Creating forms is the most important part of the platform. It's used to collect data from respondents. We spent a lot of time polishing this part to ensure readability and accessibility.

                                    responses gotten so far and the number of questions added, a share icon - to help easily
                                    share/re-share the form, add other collaborators to the form, and also a way to perform other
                                    actions on the form easily.

                                    This project is one that involved a ton of research, and detailed interaction work. However,
                                    shifting priorities and changing roadmaps delayed its launch. Still, I learned some important
                                    takeaways from this project related to product, design and business processes.
