                                    The process of collecting data for research companies is usually very painstaking and
                                    time-consuming, a lot of them assign various agents to different locations to collect the data they
                                    need. These agents move from one location to the other using their paper and pen. In many cases,
                                    weather, transportation, and other factors get in the way of successfully collecting this data, and
                                    they end up losing parts of it. There was also the issue of validating the data collected as some
                                    agents collected the same data multiple times.
                                </p>

                                    After various sessions with users, we decided to build a solution that helps business owners and researchers collect data effortlessly and also trust the data they've collected. I was the Lead Product Designer for this platform. I worked alongside the Design Lead, my Product Manager, Engineering Lead, 3 Frontend Engineers, 1 Backend Engineer, 1 Quality Assurance expert.

                                    An organization can create surveys and push them out to either their own users or our field agents. Our field agents collect these data using the mobile app, and the data is automatically uploaded to the organizations' dashboard.

                                    Research companies have to collect data for multiple organizations at the same time. We created
                                    workspaces to help them separate information between different organizations, and folders as a means
                                    to group similar forms within each organization.

                                    Creating forms is the most important part of the platform. It's used to collect data from respondents. We spent a lot of time polishing this part to ensure readability and accessibility.

                                    We paid key attention to the details of the form cards - adding a means to show the number of
                                    responses gotten so far and the number of questions added, a share icon - to help easily
                                    share/re-share the form, add other collaborators to the form, and also a way to perform other
                                    actions on the form easily.

                                    This project is one that involved a ton of research, and detailed interaction work. However,
                                    shifting priorities and changing roadmaps delayed its launch. Still, I learned some important
                                    takeaways from this project related to product, design and business processes.

                                        Delivering value amidst tight deadlines: New timelines, resourcing issues, and reprioritization
                                        meant the scope of the project was constantly changing. I had to adapt to those changes and
                                        still deliver the best design in time with tight deadlines.

                                        Choosing what features to leave out: There were many great use cases we could tackle with a rich
                                        feature set. However, every single one was costly or unrealistic. I had to work with the Product
                                        Manager and Engineering Lead to determine what was feasible within the timeframe we had.
                                    </li>

                                        Ensure the visual design passes all a11y standards: I've had to understand how important accessibility is in design and how it is very critical to create an accessible platform for people who various disabilities. This is definitely something I learned later on, on this project.

                                        Explore a responsive view for the platform. Time was essential on this project, so we didn't have a very good responsive view for it. I'd be careful never to miss this on future platforms.
